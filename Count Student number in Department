Count Student Number in Departments 

Write a query to print the respective department name and number of students majoring in each department for all departments in the department table (even ones with no current students).
Sort your results by descending number of students; if two or more departments have the same number of students, then sort those departments alphabetically by department name.
The student is described as follow:
| Column Name  | Type      |
|--------------|-----------|
| student_id   | Integer   |
| student_name | String    |
| gender       | Character |
| dept_id      | Integer   |
where student_id is the student's ID number, student_name is the student's name, gender is their gender, and dept_id is the department ID associated with their declared major.
And the department table is described as below:
| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| dept_id     | Integer |
| dept_name   | String  |
where dept_id is the department's ID number and dept_name is the department name.

Answer:
    dept_name, COUNT(student_id) AS student_number
FROM
    department
        LEFT OUTER JOIN
    student ON department.dept_id = student.dept_id
GROUP BY department.dept_name
ORDER BY student_number DESC , department.dept_name;
